# Travelling-salesman-Problem
Problem statement:
Given a set of vertices(cities) and distance between every pair of vertices(cities), the problem is to find the shortest possible tour that visits every vertex(city) exactly once and returns to the starting point.

SOLUTION:
We have implemented the travelling salesman problem using two important methods:
1. Branch and Bound Algorithm
2. Backtracking

Algorithms are described in Pdf attached to it. In case of Branch and Bound Algorithm, we have implement travelling salesman problem as search problem. To generate the tree two data structures are used: a stack and a circular queue. 
In case of Backtraking, we first create all Hamiltonian Cycles using Deep Backtracking Concepts. Then among these Hamiltonian cycles, the travelling salesman problem corresponds to minimum cost cycles.
